## Image Classification of Blue Tarps from 2010 Haitian Earthquake Crisis

During the Haitian Earthquake Crisis of 2010, a key method by which to identify survivors was
by locating manmade shelters. Based on the problem statement, many of these shelters used
Blue Tarps as covers. Using images taken and classified by the Rochester Institute of Technology,
we will attempt to fit optimal models for classifying pixels in the images as either “Tarp” or
“Non-Tarp”. In this case, “Tarp” indicates the presence of a Blue Tarp and likely, displaced
peoples, while “Non-Tarp” indicates image pixels of other classes (Rooftop, Soil, Vegetation,
Various Non-Tarp). The 7 model types are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Penalized Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Decisions on parameter tuning, threshold selection, model
results and comparisons, and data transformations will all be explained in the report. The end
goal is to have a model which very accurately identifies displaced people.
